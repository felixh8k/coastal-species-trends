# Trends in Thunnus albacares Occurrence (GBIF Data)

## Project Overview

This project explores temporal and spatial patterns in the occurrence records of Thunnus albacares — Yellowfin Tuna, using openly available biodiversity data from GBIF
.
The goal is to demonstrate how reproducible data workflows can uncover meaningful insights for marine conservation.

### Main questions:

How have reported occurrences of Thunnus albacares changed over time?

Are there seasonal patterns in observations?

What are the potential implications for monitoring and conservation?


## Repository Structure

## Tech Stack

Language: Python 3.11 (or R alternative)

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, folium, statsmodels

Data Source: Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) API

Reproducibility: Jupyter Notebooks + GitHub


## Methods

- Data Acquisition

- Queried GBIF API for Thunnus albacares records between 2000 - 2024.

- Exported data in CSV format.

- Data Cleaning

- Removed missing or invalid coordinates.

- Converted and standardized event dates.

- Extracted year and month fields.

- Exploratory Analysis

- Plotted annual occurrence counts.

- Generated an interactive sampling map (Folium).

- Statistical Analysis

- Aggregated occurrences per month/year.

- Conducted time series decomposition to identify trends and seasonality.

- Applied linear regression to test for long-term change.

- Visualization

- Built interactive Plotly dashboard for temporal trends.

- Created summary slides with key figures and conservation implications.


## Results (to fill in after analysis)

Trend: Occurrence records show [increase/decrease/stability] from [start year] to [end year].

Seasonality: Clear peaks observed in [months/season], suggesting [possible explanation].

Statistical test: Trend slope = [X], p = [Y] (significant / not significant).

## Conservation Implications

These results suggest that:

Thunnus albacares sightings are [increasing/decreasing] in [region].

Seasonal occurrence patterns may align with [migration/spawning/fishing pressure].

Open biodiversity data can provide valuable signals for monitoring, though reporting biases should be considered.
